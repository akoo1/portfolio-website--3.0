A portfolio that showcases my top skills and projects using JavaScript, SASS, and HTML5 that is responsive and mobile-friendly.

It is built with the lastest CSS features, proper CSS file architecture, and BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) methodology for CSS class naming convention for better component reusibily and project scalibility.

The overall design of the portfolio was inspired by one of the projects from the Udemy course "Advanced CSS and SASS: FlexBox, Grid, and Animation".

I added my own design spin to it to make it an interactive and animated website, sepcifically designed for a developer portfolio.
